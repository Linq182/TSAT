<font size="6" color="Magenta">TSAT: Radiation HeatX Coefficient - Non-Reflective Sink Library Block</font>
<br>
<p>This function computes the radiation heat transfer coefficient when the radiation term is written in a linear form (q = u*(Text - Tsurf)). This block is applicable for radiation between a surface and a non-reflective sink such as a distant black body. The equation for calculating the heat transfer coefficient is given below.<p>
$$
u = \epsilon \sigma \left( T_{sink}^2 + T_{surf}^2 \right) \left( T_{sink} + T_{surf} \right)
$$
<p>where<p>
$$
u = radiation \: heat \: transfer \: coefficient
$$
$$
\epsilon = emmisivity \: of \: the \: surface
$$
$$
\sigma = Boltzmann's \: constant
$$
$$
T_{surf} = temperature \: of \: the \: surface 
$$
$$
T_{sink} = temperature \: of \: the \: sink
$$
<p>This block requires specific units be used. The units are clearly indicated on the input and output ports as well as the tables below. <p>
<p>This block accepts inputs of various dimensions as long as all inputs are consistent in dimensions. <p>
