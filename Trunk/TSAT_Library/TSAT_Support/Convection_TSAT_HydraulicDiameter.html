<p>This block calculates the hydraulic diameter (Dh) of an arbitrary shape based on its area (A) and perimeter (P). The units of the inputs must be consistent and the units of the outputs will be the same as the length unit used in the inputs. The hydrualic diameter is useful for evaluating heat transfer in non-circular tubes. The equation for calculating the hydraulic diameter is simply:<p>
$$
Dh = \frac{4A}{P}
$$
<p>In most applications this block may be used to return a single hydraulic diameter for a single tube of constant cross-sectional shape. However, this block does have ability to perform multiple calculations given consistently sized 1-D arrays for each of the inputs.<p>
