<font size="6" color="Magenta">TSAT: Air Properies - Specific Heat at Constant Volume Library Block</font>
<br>
<p>This function provides an estimate of the constant volume specific heat of air given its temperature and density. The function uses empirical relations which are valid for dry air in the temperature range of 60K - 2000K (108R - 3600R) and pressures up to 2000MPa. The resource for this empirical correlations is: <p>
<p>Lemmon, E., Jacobsen, R., Penoncello, S., and Friend, D., Thermodynamic Properties of Air and Mixtures of Nitrogen, Argon, and Oxygen From 60 to 2000K at pressure to 2000MPa, Journal of Physics Chemistry Reference Data, Vol. 29, No. 3, 2000
<p>This function is capable of evaluating the specific heat for various temperatures at the same time given an arrays of temperature and density.
<p>Units are clearly stated on the inport and outport so assure that your inputs are in the specified units and the output is properly converted to your desired units after the calculation.<p>
