<p>Reference for the information in this help file and the presented correlation: Incropera, F.P., and DeWitt, D.P., Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer, John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY, 2002. Print.<p>
<p>The block approximates the local Nusselt number for fully developed turbulent flow in a smooth circular tube using the Sieder-Tate correlation.<p>
$$
Nu = 0.027Re^{4/5}Pr^{1/3} \left( \frac{\mu}{\mu_s} \right)^{0.14}
$$
<p>For tubes with different shaped cross-sections this correlation can be used as a first approximation with the hydraulic diameter of the tube used in place of the tube diameter. The equation attempts to account for variations in thermal properties of the fluid which is mainly done through considering the viscosity of the fluid at the mean fluid temperature and at the tube surface temperature. This block is recommended more so than the Dittus-Boelter equation when the variation in temperature between the surface of the pipe and the bulk fluid is large. Restrictions to this correlation include:<p>
$$
0.7 \leq Pr \leq 16700, \: Re \geq 10000
$$
<p>If any of these conditions are not met then the Validty output will be 1, otherwise it will be 0. Also keep in mind that the fully developed assumption typically meanse the local point of interest be at a lenght from the inlet that is 10 times the tube diameter. This correlation is a good approxiamtion for uniform surface temperature and heat flux conditions. In most applications this block may be used to return a single Nusselt number for a single pipe of uniform conditions. However, this block does have ability to perform multiple calculations of Nusselt number given consistently sized 1-D arrays for each of the inputs. The viscosity inputs can be in any viscosity unit as long as they are both in the same units.<p>
