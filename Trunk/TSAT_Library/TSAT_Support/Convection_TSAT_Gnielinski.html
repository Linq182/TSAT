<p>This block approximates the Nusselt number of a fully developed turbulent internal flow using Gnielinski's correlation.<p>
$$
Nu = \frac{(f/8)(Re-1000)Pr}{1+12.7(f/8)^{1/2}(Pr^{2/3}-1)}
$$
<p>This block provides the option to consider a perfectly smooth or a rough surface. The user is cautioned that Gnielinski's correlation is valid for smooth tubes and so it may become less accurate as surface roughenss increases. Infact it should provide a good first approximation for friction factors (f) that are less than ~4 times it's corresponding smooth surface value. When roughnees increases to the point that f is 4 times larger than the smooth value then additional increases in f will not impact the heat transfer coefficient and thus Nu as well. This result is taken from:
<p>R. H. Norris, A. E. Bergles, and R. L. Webb, Eds., Augmentation of Convective Heat and Mass Transfer, ASME. New York. 1970.<p>
<p>As a result, the friction factor in this block is restricted to being less than or equal to 4 times the value of the smooth wall friction factor. Surface roughness is accounted for using the Colebrook correlation. The Colebrook correlation is solved using an iterative technique and so a convergence variable (conv) is output when this option is active so the it can be monitored. This correlaiton is valid for the following conditions:
$$
0.5 \leq Pr \leq 2000, \: 3000 \leq Re \leq 5000000
$$
<p>If any of these conditions are not met then the Validty output will be 1, otherwise it will be 0. In addition to these conditions one should keep in mind that this approximation is only valid for fully developed turbulent flow which is generally applicable when the flow is downstream of the inlet by a distance that is greater than or equal to 10 times the diamter of the tube (L/D >= 10). The correlation is applicable for both isothermal and isoflux applications. The properties in the correlation should be evaluated at the bulk fluid temperature. If a large temperature difference is present then additional considerations must be given. Available options are reviewed by Kakac in: S. Kakac, R.K. Shah, and W. Aung.
