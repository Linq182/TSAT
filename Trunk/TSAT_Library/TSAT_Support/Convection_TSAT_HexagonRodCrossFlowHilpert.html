<font size="6" color="Magenta">TSAT: Hexagonal Rod Cross Flow - Hilpert Library Block</font>
<br>
<p>This block estimates the average Nusselt number of an external flow over an isothermal rod with a hexagonal cross-section. The correlation employed was originally developed by Hilpert and has been modified to address non-circular cross-sectional shapes:<p>
<p>R. Hilpert, Forsch . Geb. Ingenieurwes., 4 , 215, 1933<p>
<p>M. Jakoh, Heat Transfer, Vol. 1, Wiley, New York, 1949<p>
<p>E. M. Sparrow, J. P. Abraham, and J. C. K. Tong, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer, 47, 5285, 2004<p>
<p>and has been modified to account for fluids with a wider range of Prandtl numbers. It has options to address the case in which the flow is directed at a point of the hexagon or a side. The equation is given as:<p>
$$
Nu = CRe^{m}Pr^{1/3}
$$
<p>where Nu is the Nusselt number, Re is the Reynolds number, Pr is the Prandtl number, and the coefficients C and m are given in the table below:<p>
<font size="5" color="Blue"> Model Coefficients:</font>
<table border="1"><tr><td>Flow direction</td><td>C</td><td>m</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Flow at point</td><td>0.150</td><td>0.638</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Flow at face (Re = 5200 to 20400)</td><td>0.164</td><td>0.638</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Flow at face (Re = 20400 to 105000)</td><td>0.039</td><td>0.78</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>Note that when the flow is directed at a face, the Reynolds number should be calculated based on the length from opposite sides of the hexagon and when the flow is directed at a point, the Reynolds number should be calculated based on the length from opposite points of the hexagon. The properties of the fluid should be evaluated at the film temperature. The correlation is subject to the following restrictions when the flow is directed at a point:<p>
$$
4500 \leq Re \leq 90700, \: Pr \geq 0.7
$$
<p>and the following restrictions when the flow is directed at a side:<p>
$$
5200 \leq Re \leq 105000, \: Pr \geq 0.7
$$
<p>This block is capable of performing multiple Nusselt number approximations given 1-D input arrays of the same size.<p>
