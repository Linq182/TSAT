<p>This block estimates the average Nusselt number of free convecting flow over an isothermal vertical or inclined flat plate, or an isothermal vertical cylinder. For inclined plates the correlation is only valid for the top surface of cold plates and bottom surface of hot plates. The bottom surface of cold plates and top surface of hot plates experience a complex 3-D flow that typically enhances heat transfer but is not able to be characterized by a generalized correlation. The following correlation is recommended for the entire range of Raleigh numbers (Ra):<p>
$$
Nu = \left{ 0.825 + \frac{0.387Ra^{1/6}}{\left[ 1 + \left( 0.492/Pr \right)^{9/16} \right]^{8/27}} \right}^{2}
$$
<p>Subject to restriction:<p>

<p>The next correlation has slightly better accuracy for laminar flow

$$
<p>Subject to restriction:<p>

<p>These equations are valid for vertical plates and vertical cylinders. These equations can be used to approximate the average Nusselt number for inclined plates but only for one surface as mentioned before. In such a case the gravity, g, is replace by g*cos(Angle) where Angle is the inclination angle relative to the vertical axis in which gravity is acting. This adjustment makes the correlation good for angles between 0 and 60 degrees.
$$
y = 0: \: u = v = 0, \: T = T_{s}
$$
$$
y \rightarrow \infty: \: u \rightarrow 0, \: T \rightarrow T_{\infty}
$$
<p>where<p>
$$
u = the \: velocity \: in \: the \: vertical  \: direction, \: v = the \: velocity \: in \: the \: horizontal \: direction
$$
$$
T_{s} = temperature \: of \: the \: surface, \: T_{\infty} = temperature \: of \: the \: quiescent \: medium
$$
<p>The solution is:<p>
$$
Nu = \frac{4}{3} \left( \frac{Gr}{4} \right)^{1/4} g(Pr)
$$
<p>where<p>
$$
g(Pr) = \frac{0.75 Pr^{1/2}}{ \left( 0.609 + 1.221 Pr^{1/2} + 1.238 Pr \right)^{1/4} }
$$
<p>Gr is the Grashof number and Pr is the Prandtl number. Note that this solution comes from the following references<p>
<p>S. Ostrach, "An Analysis of Laminar Free Convection Flow and Heat Transfer About a Flat Plate Parallel to the Direaction of the Generating Body Force," National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, Report 1111, 1953.<p>

<p>Because the solution was derived for laminar flow this correlation is only valid for such cases which is typically when the Rayliegh number (Ra) is less than ~10^9. Note that all fluid properties should be evaluated at film temperature (average of the bulk fluid and surface temperatures). This block is capable of performing multiple calculations given 1-D arrays of consistent size for the inputs.<p>
